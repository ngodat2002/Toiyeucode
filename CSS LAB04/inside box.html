<h2>The Cottage Garden</h2>
<p >The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design,dense plantings, and a mixture of ormamental and edible plants</p>
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in1870's England,when stylized versions were formed as a<br/>reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>Englich estate ardens.</u></p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,along with some fruit trees.</p>
